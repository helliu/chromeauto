# Chrome Script Runner Extension


This project represents my first software developed with the collaboration of ChatGPT. The next steps will be to use ChatGPT to enhance the code quality and design.

## Description

Chrome Script Runner is a powerful utility for Chrome that allows users to create, save, and execute custom JavaScript scripts on-the-fly. Scripts can be written and edited within the extension and executed at any time with the press of a button. This is incredibly useful for web development, debugging, and even automating tasks in the browser.

## Features

1. **Create Scripts**: Users can easily create new JavaScript files within the extension and write custom scripts.
2. **Save Scripts**: All scripts are saved locally in the browser and persist across sessions.
3. **Execute Scripts**: Scripts can be run at any time with a single click. Simply select the script you want to run and press the "Run" button.
4. **Manage Scripts**: Users have the ability to rename and delete scripts. Simply select the script you wish to manage and press the corresponding button.
5. **Hotkey Support**: Users can assign hotkeys to scripts for quick and easy access.

## How to Use

1. **Add New Script**: Click on the "+" button. A prompt will ask you to name your script.
2. **Select Script**: Click on a script from the list to select it. The selected script will have a border around it.
3. **Edit Script**: With a script selected, you can edit it in the script editor.
4. **Run Script**: With a script selected, click on the "▷" button to run the script.
5. **Delete Script**: With a script selected, click on the "-" button to delete the script.
6. **Rename Script**: With a script selected, press F2 to rename the script.

## Installation

2. In Chrome, go to the Extensions page (`chrome://extensions`).
3. Enable Developer mode (toggle switch in the top right).
4. Click on "Load unpacked".

## Note

This extension uses Chrome's local storage to save scripts, so any scripts you create will persist across sessions.
